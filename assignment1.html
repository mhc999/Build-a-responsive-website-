        <h1 class = "type1"> Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan? </h1>
        <p class = "type2"> After 20 years of war, the Taliban have swept to victory in Afghanistan.<br>

            The group completed their shockingly rapid advance across the country by capturing Kabul on 15 August.<br>
            
            It comes after foreign forces announced their withdrawal following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001.<br>
            
            The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.<br>
            
            Taliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West.<br>
            
            But questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms.<br></p>
        <h2 class = "type1"> Why did the US fight a war in Afghanistan and why did it last so long? </h2>
        <p class = "type2"> Back in 2001, the US was responding to the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Officials identified Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and its leader Osama Bin Laden, as responsible.<br>

            Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamists who had been in power since 1996.<br>
            
            When they refused to hand him over, the US intervened militarily, quickly removing the Taliban and vowing to support democracy and eliminate the terrorist threat.<br>
            
        </p>
        <h2 class = "type1"> Who are the Taliban? </h2>
        <p class = "type2">They emerged in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, predominantly in the south-west and the Pakistan border areas.<br>

            They vowed to fight corruption and improve security, but also followed an austere form of Islam.<br>

            By 1998, they had taken control of almost all of the country.<br>
